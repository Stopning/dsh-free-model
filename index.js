/**
 * Our Free Model — plugin entry (Host half), channels-only fork.
 *
 * Upstream 2.1.0 shipped nine settings pages behind one host: an anonymous free
 * lane (opencode.ai), a Kilo free pool, the GitHub-gated EAC co-paid lane, a
 * 76-provider aggregate lane with bring-your-own keys, named fallback chains
 * (combos), a token-saving pipeline that runs inside that one adapter, a
 * first-run announcement feed, a remote-published self-updater and a hot reload.
 *
 * This fork keeps exactly one of them: the absorbed channel pack
 * (`vendor/channel-pack`), which carries the thirteen 白嫖 account providers
 * (CodeArts, CodeBuddy / WorkBuddy, LobsterAI, Qoder / Qoder CN, TRAE, Cline,
 * Loomy, Raccoon, MiniMax Code, ZCode, Gemini) and their OpenAI-compatible
 * loopback gateway. Everything that hung off the plugin's own model adapter is
 * gone, together with its routes, stores, timers and files.
 *
 * What this half still owns:
 *   - the settings file (`egress`, `chanGateway.relay`);
 *   - the egress outlet the pack sends its traffic through;
 *   - the pack's gateway relay — this plugin's own key, LAN-optional;
 *   - the JSON API the four remaining settings pages read
 *     (白嫖模型接入 / 数据看板 / 运行日志 / 网关设置).
 *
 * The dashboard and the request log do not come from here: the pack keeps its
 * own per-request token ledger and serves it over the shell's `connection` RPC,
 * so nothing in this half has to measure a turn.
 *
 * `llm` stays the only declared dependency. The pack mounts onto
 * `credentials`/`commands`/`llm` in a nested fiber of its own, so a composition
 * without a web server still serves models, and a composition that omits the
 * pack's services degrades to "no channels" instead of failing the plugin.
